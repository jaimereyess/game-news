                <Introduction title="MMO GAMES">
                    MMO games (Massively Multiplayer Online) are those that allow interaction
                    among thousands of players from all over the world in the same virtual world
                    and in real-time. These games are usually set in fantasy or science fiction
                    worlds and offer players a wide variety of activities such as quests, battles,
                    character creation, trade, and more. MMOs rely on internet connectivity and
                    require a central server that hosts the virtual world where the game takes place,
                    enabling players to interact and compete with one another.
